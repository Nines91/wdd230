                <p>It's a flight landing page, here we casn see that the developers are applying <b>Hick's Law</b> because it is easy to understand and they ask the user for a little informationabout the trip, so it avoids asking for a lot information at once.
                What <b>Hick's Law</b> tell us is that the time that must be spent making a decision increases with the number of options and the complexity available.<br>
                In other words: the more options there are and the more complexity that is added to a design, the more difficult it will be for the user to understand what they are doing and choose what they should do.

                <p><b>White space</b> is any blank or empty space that surrounds all other elements of a design. It is the space between text, images, buttons, and other objects that the user can see on a page or screen.
                It is an essential element in any design and provides many benefits when used well. <br>
                One of its benefits is: increasing user interaction.
                In website design, white space promotes visual hierarchy and helps users easily find the information they are looking for.
                Putting a good amount of white space around headers, headlines, buttons, and navigation menus can immediately prompt users to take an action, plus it avoids distractions that can take users away from their goal, which is consume content.
                On the main page we see a good example of this.

                <p>Having good color <b>contrast</b> on your website benefits all your users. By using the development tools to verify the contrast of this page we can see that there is no error in the contrast, in addition to them the large yellow button is what stands out the most at first glance and invites us to want to enter the page and navigate in the same.
